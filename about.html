<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sai Sahaara Surkanti currently studying 3 rd year undergraduate student in the dept of  mechanical engineering.During my two years in college, I have learned and got hands-on experience in C++, the basics of Python, SQL and front-end development using tools like Tkinter GUI,HTML,CSS and Javascript.</p>

<p> I worked on building a Guess The Number game using Tkinter GUI as apart of course. I took part in robotics competition held by IIT Bombay named "Pharma Bot" to build autonomous delivery robot. 
  I have explored the field of consulting by participating in the 6-week consult school conducted by 180 degrees consulting, IIT Madras and submitted 3 case studies as a part of it.</p>
  
<p>I have adequate technical knowledge, and yet I scattered my free time into working on activities that helped me learn some organising skills by managing events and taking up challenges. I am Campus Mantree at Geeks for Geeks. I served as Team Leader at NSS IIT Ropar. I am a sponsorship team member and volunteer at Pehchaan Ek Safar. I am also non-core member of Carrer Development and Placement cell, IIT Ropar.
  I am a hard-working and Innovative person who always thrives to improve and upskill myself. I embrace change positively to work beyond my comfort and give my best.</p></p>
